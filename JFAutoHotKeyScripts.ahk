#	Win (Windows logo key).[v1.0.48.01+]: For Windows Vista and later, hotkeys that include Win (e.g. #a) will wait for Win to be released before sending any text containing an L keystroke. This prevents usages of Send within such a hotkey from locking the PC. This behavior applies to all sending modes except SendPlay (which doesn't need it) and blind mode. [v1.1.29+]: Text mode is also excluded.
	Note: Pressing a hotkey which includes Win may result in extra simulated keystrokes (Ctrl by default). See #MenuMaskKey.

!	Alt Note: Pressing a hotkey which includes Alt may result in extra simulated keystrokes (Ctrl by default). See #MenuMaskKey.
^	Ctrl
+	Shift
&	An ampersand may be used between any two keys or mouse buttons to combine them into a custom hotkey. See below for details.
<	Use the left key of the pair. e.g. <!a is the same as !a except that only the left Alt will trigger it.
>	Use the right key of the pair.
